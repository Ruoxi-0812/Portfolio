        <h2>STEP 2: Smart Glasses with Mobile Connectivity Proposal</h2>
        <p>Traditional eyeglasses play an important role in vision correction, but people often have problems finding them, 
           such as forgetting to put them somewhere the day before or losing them. This redesign introduces smart glasses 
           with mobile connectivity, integrating Bluetooth tracking and vision monitoring sensors to enhance functionality. 
           These glasses will allow users to locate them via a mobile phone app, while detecting the clarity of vision and 
           receiving mobile phone alerts when glasses need to be replaced and the prescription raised. By combining convenience 
           with proactive eye care, this design aims to improve usability and accessibility for individuals who rely on eyeglasses daily.
        </p>

        <h2>Audience & Purpose</h2>
        <p>The audience for this redesigned object includes students, professionals, and elderly individuals with myopia. 
           The Bluetooth tracking feature eliminates the frustration of misplacing glasses, while the visual monitoring 
           system detects the user's vision and ensures the glasses are usable. The product promotes convenience, efficiency, 
           and active vision monitoring, allowing users to focus more on their daily activities. Not only do these glasses 
           improve vision, but this integration of visual health monitoring ensures a stress-free experience for users who 
           often forget routine eye exams.
        </p>

        <h2>Form & Material</h2>
        <p>The smart glasses will maintain the aesthetics and comfort of traditional eyewear while making technical improvements. 
           Its frame will be made of lightweight titanium, and small sensors and Bluetooth modules will be embedded in the legs. 
           The lenses will be equipped with adaptive vision sensors capable of detecting subtle changes in vision. This design ensures 
           long-term wearability without being heavier than regular glasses, allowing people to wear them without any discomfort.
        </p>

        <h2>Usability & Location</h2>
        <p>
            These glasses are designed for daily wear at home, school, work, and while traveling. Key usability features include: <br>
            <strong>• Bluetooth tracking:</strong> Users can locate misplaced glasses via a mobile app, triggering a beeping sound or vibration. <br>
            <strong>• Vision monitoring:</strong> Sensors analyze eye fatigue and visual clarity and send a notification if the degree needs to be changed. <br>
            <strong>• Touch controls:</strong> A small swipe or tap feature on the temple enables battery checks and app synchronization. <br>
            While these glasses provide significant advantages, they are only beneficial for users who require vision correction. 
            Additionally, like other smart devices, they will require occasional charging, which could be a minor inconvenience for some users.
        </p> 
        
        <h2>Paper Prototype</h2>
        <p>To illustrate the foundation of this object, I made a paper prototype of a standard pair of eyeglasses before redesigning it.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Research Findings</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>• Smart Eyewear Trends:</strong> Companies such as Google, Meta, and Bose are investing in smart glasses, integrating AR, Bluetooth, and other technologies into eyewear.<br>
            <strong>• Material Science in Eyewear:</strong> Titanium and lightweight plastics are widely used in modern eyewear due to their durability, flexibility, and comfort. These materials allow for the integration of small electronic components without adding excessive weight.<br>
            <strong>• Vision Health Study:</strong> Many users do not realize changes in vision until their eyes feel tired or uncomfortable. Studies have shown that early detection of vision changes can improve long-term eye health and prevent deterioration of vision.<br>
